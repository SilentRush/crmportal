We do not know when this happened, or who made the change. Last week, I changed the Account Manager back to Toni Brkljach. If you could track which user made the original change to Bonnie Orlando, and when, that would be great.\r\n\r\n2 - Today, we realized that the Account Manager for ICA # 1064 and ICA # 6751 changed from Toni Brkljach to Lucas Ely.  Again, we do not know when this happened, or who made the change. If you could track which user made this change in July, that would be great.  I have not yet made the change back to Toni Brkljach.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy questions are \r\n\r\n1. Is there anyway we can find who updated the account record at a given date/time ?.\r\n2.

They just didn't keep the site up to date. \r\n\r\nThird problem - explaining how to do a database backup and restore. Of course, Srini doesn't have the rights so he can't do it himself. Since the SLXMCT database is out of date (lots of object errors from previous imports), I want to restore it from the known-good slxMcd - otherwise it's a waste of time. \r\n\r\nFourth problem - Enable license enabler file on a machine without internet access. (This is a pain in the ass. I also had to find the license key)\r\n\r\nFifth problem - configure Qlikview server to work. Copy files. So that VA works. \r\n\r\nSixth problem - back to the stupid nav item? Watching the deployment happen. Trying to get off the call now. \r\n\r\nSeventh problem - how to do the linkpoint on three machines. <sigh> Who cares? Well, apparently they do since they need three boxes exactly the same. I do not want to do this configuration crap but apparently I'm shafted with it. Seriously. If I'm doing crap like this I will never get RF Installations done. Anyways. I configured it by adding the license key, and removing the impersonate crap from the web.config file. \r\n\r\nEighth issue - re-deploying so that the va button appears in the nav bar. Even though the va will never refresh on this server. I'm not going to volunteer to set that up. It should be a link to prod. Got the connection working. \r\n\r\nNinth issue - back to the database being out of date. Also, the copy of the VFS errored out and he tried to deploy it. Of course that fails. The errors are ugly, but with the database out of date, there's no telling what caused it. "

I don't have a Citrix machine that I can reference so I can't tell you exactly how the hive will load. Regardless, the key will be under:\r\n\r\n<loadedHive>\\Software\\Saleslogix\\ADOLogin\\Connection1\r\n\r\nYou don't need to change ALIAS. This is the user's name for the connection (SLXStage  for example)\r\nYou need to change Data Source to be the computer name for the connection (STLSLOGIXP1)\r\nAnd you need to change Initial Catalog to be the name of the connection specified in the connection manager on STLSLOGIXP1.\r\n\r\nYou can reference what these values should be by first creating a connection in the Saleslogix Client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever - I'm not sure if you're aware, but you are able to use the same connection manager on STLSLOGIXP01 to create multiple connections to multiple saleslogix instances. So you can have STLSLOGIXP01 have two connections --- SaleslogixLocalAccts and SaleslogixUsCommerce can co-exist on the same saleslogix server, while using separate databases.

        "Notes": "Sent the following e-mail. \r\n\r\nVA installation for the local accounts division will not require any ports to be open, depending on how you install and configure the system. \r\n\r\nThe possible configurations are:\r\n\r\n1. Use the network client that is built into Saleslogix for Visual Analyzer (Recommended)\r\n2. Create a new web-site for Visual Analyzer.  (requires a new computer to host the web site)\r\n3. Create a Qlikview web-site that does not associate any Visual Analyzer components. \r\n\r\nMy recommended installation for Visual Analyzer when using a network client is to install the Visual Analyzer client on the Citrix machine (and each users' machine where the Saleslogix LAN client is installed), as well as applying two bundles to the Saleslogix database (these bundles can be found with the visual analyzer installation). You will not require any ports to be opened. The Visual Analyzer integrated piece requires two bundles to be applied to the Saleslogix server*. After installing the VA client to the citrix machine, the file location needs to be configured. Details for this are found in the attached PDF, as will details for the complete installation.  The Visual Analyzer.qvd file can be found in c:\\documents and settings\\all users\\Application Data\\Saleslogix\\Visual Analyzer. The defaults should be sufficient. You need to refresh this document the first time to update the values to match the existing database, as well as schedule a regular re-load. Please note that the file exists on all local users' machines. You should update it to work from a shared network location (such as the SLX library directory) so that it only has to be refreshed once.\r\n\r\nI'll tell you a little bit about #2 and #3 - but I think you should go with the first solution. From a user perspective, #2 and #3 are the same - except that you have to specify the filename in the URL that is provided to a user. If you use this configuration, 2 ports -- a website port and a port for Qlikview server are going to be required. You cannot use the existing Visual Analyzer web site to host a second Visual Analyzer file. These ports can be changed and do not necessarily need to be the same as we have on stlslogixp01 (3335 and 4747).  I don't think #2 makes sense to do at this time, as it would require a separate server to host it on (I do not believe it is possible to configure two Qlikview Servers on the same computer).  The third option is a possibility, as the file would be accessed through a URL like QVP://stlslogixp01/LocalAccountsVisualAnalyzer.qvw. However, the problem is that this link needs to be referenced regularly and the qlikview plugin needs to be installed on all machines that require it. You would not need to open any additional ports on stlslogixp01 for this to work. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any further details. \r\n\r\nBrian Mooy\r\nSoftware Developer\r\nStrategic Sales Systems\r\nOffice: 314-225-2025\r\nCell: 314-609-4643\r\n\r\n* These bundles were already applied as part of the Saleslogix update done at the end of October. A Visual Analyzer button should be found under the Dashboards side-item. If this item is not found, re-apply the bundle named \"Visual Analyzer Toolbar.sxb\"\r\n\r\n"
